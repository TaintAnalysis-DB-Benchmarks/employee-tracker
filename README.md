# Employee Tracker

## Description

This project was an extremely difficult task in which I had to utilize mysql/sequelize and inquirer along with express and node to create a command line employee tracker application.
The biggest challenge had to be getting the table to function properly and even still there are some hiccups with updating it.
Hopfully you enjoy and thank you for checking out my program!
